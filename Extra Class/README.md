# OOP

1. `Abstraction`
- a class
- elements of a class: Name of class, attributes, methods, events, relationships
The attributes are `private`
methods are usually `public`

- we want the method public
- public interfaces help with calling one method with another 
- just choose the elements you need from software application


2. `Encapuslation`
- private data


3. `Polymorphism`
- different shape
- If you have a software with geometrical shapes for example a circle class, rectangle, square, triangle
- if we have to create this software teach parameters of the shape
- one requirement is to allow the user to see the area and parameter of the shapes
- You need to use the same signature but each shape uses different formulas
- same purposes but different functions is the definition of polymorphism
- we could use an interface 


4. `Inheritance`
- this has types of something
- if we have a shape class then the calss may have elements that are inherited and no abstract
- 2 rules: 100% rule - child class must have all elements of parent, and plut must be of the same type



## C# unit testing framework
- xUnit
- NUnit
- MSTest


## SQL Data reader
- it will only read the SQL database reader ( `SqlDataReader` ) and it will automatically close so this will help with performance
- without that data reader it will cause errors because it will keep the connection open which will eventually cause errors


## Exam
- based on labs and exams it will be based on the exam
