# What are the 4 OOP?

1. Abstraction
- Real entity and Class.
- Abstract real bunny for example attributes/behaviours like color and age. You don't get all the properties only the important ones

2. Encapsulation
- always clear
- dont use public variables in Classes they are private

3. Polymorphism
- same output but different implementation
- interface the classes create it
- same signature and different implementation
- Example you can have different classes for triangle, circle etc
- all of these classes have the same method called area so the signature is the same but how you calculate it is different for each shape

4. Inheritance
- relationship between parent/child
- there are 2 rules:
```
1. 100% rule 
- child must be 100% that of the parent has. If one is different then it cannot work. Plus its own attributes

2. EASE A
- same type as parent
```
