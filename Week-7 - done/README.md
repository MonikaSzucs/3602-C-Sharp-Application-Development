# Class Notes Week 7

- event driven programming is the most complicated here
- class that raises the event, listener to event, event proceedure when triggered

- windows forms which is a way to move away from teh console app and to a more advanced UI.

- Keyboard navigation - you can control when teh user clicks in teh type box or typesor when mouse over etc


## Use Windows Forms
- use 5.0 when you setup new project
- then you can downgrade to 4.8

- always name the form
- in the parcial class it is autmatically generated by you by .NET
- you must have a naming convention for all the controls

## Event Driven Programming
1. Event source
2. Event handler
3. Action taken

## Tab order
- select the entire form then go to View > Tab order 
- then you can click those blue squares and order it
