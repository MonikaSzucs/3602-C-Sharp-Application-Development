# Abstraction


## Selecting the elements you need 
-	House
        Square feet of the house and owner 
-	Description everything that describes and entity is an attribute
-	Everything that is a behaviour is a method


## Why do we put all code outputting to a console through  a dedicated class?
-	The UI classes 
-	Data classes
-	They are data holders
-	Data classes have the attributes and behaviours belonging to the entity 
-	The classes that have connection stream they are called data classes

## Inheritance two rules:
-	Is a rule
        Derived class must be the same as the derived class
-	100% rule
